## Hi, I'm AntÃ³nio ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I just graduated in Computer Science Engineering, in University of Beira Interior, but I'm still going after knowledge and experience.

ðŸ¤” My main interests in this area are Software Engineering, Game Development and Network Systems Management (but I am open to try things that I haven't considered before).

âš¡ With my education in music (Graduated from ConservatÃ³rio Regional de Castelo Branco), my problem-solving capacity and my good communication habits, I believe that my capabilities are valuable for any team.
